Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is Teodor Tchalakov and I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign passionate in researching and designing robust and adaptive robotic systems through a holistic understanding of all levels of the computing system from hardware to software. I am currently interested in robot motion and decision making. I enjoy the challenge of taking academic papers and trying to make them work in the real world.
