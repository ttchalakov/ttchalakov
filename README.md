Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is Teodor Tchalakov and I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign passionate in researching and designing robust and adaptive robotic systems through a holistic understanding of all levels of the computing system from hardware to software. I am currently interested in robot motion planning and decision making. I also enjoy the challenge of taking academic papers and trying to make them work in the real world. Previously, I have worked with Java, C/C++, Python, Bash, C#, Git, gradle, Maven, Linux/Unix, ROOT Statistical Framework, and PYTHIA.

I have had multiple years of experience programming in FRC robotics, Particle Physics Research at Fermilab with the CMS experiment, and other projects.
I am looking for others to collaborate and learn alongside in a team so feel free to contact me at teodor.tch@gmail.com.
